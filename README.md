# DMIL-WDDS
Thanks for your concerns about our work -- "An in-field automatic wheat disease diagnosis system". We have released our source codes in this GitHub repository.

We are sorry about that the collected dataset "WDD2017" is not publicly available for the time being because of the commercial technology project. 

Note that the pre-trained model “vgg16.pkl” and "vgg_cnn_s.pkl" 
Our codes are written in Python and the deep models are implemented with Theano. The relevant path names in our codes should be modified if you want to run these codes.
